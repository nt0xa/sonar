Sonar is a security researcher's Swiss army knife for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that require out-of-band interactions.
It is similar to [Burp Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/collaborator) or [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh), but offers some useful additional features.

See the docs for details: https://nt0xa.github.io/sonar/
