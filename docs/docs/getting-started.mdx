# Getting started

Sonar is a security researcher's Swiss army knife for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that require out-of-band interactions.
It is similar to [Burp Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/collaborator) or [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh), but offers some useful additional features.


- Ability to create named payloads and receive notifications in the messenger of choice about all interactions with these subdomains via DNS, HTTP, FTP and SMTP.
- Configurable DNS answers with ability to return multiple records for name or setup DNS rebinding for subdomain.
- Configurable HTTP responses: static or dynamic using Go templates.
